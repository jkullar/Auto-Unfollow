# 🚀 LinkedIn Auto-Unfollow Script

### 📢 Unfollow All Companies on LinkedIn Automatically  

This **Tampermonkey/Greasemonkey** script automates the process of **unfollowing all companies** on LinkedIn. It:  
✅ **Clicks the "Following" button** on each company  
✅ **Handles the confirmation popup** to confirm unfollowing  
✅ **Unfollows all visible companies first**, then scrolls to load more  
✅ **Repeats the process until no followed companies remain**  
✅ **Runs in the background**, so you can switch tabs while it works
